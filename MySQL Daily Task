MySQL Daily Activity --
===================================================================================================================================================

Date 08-04-2025: I setup MySQL on my laptop, read about DDL and DML and exercising on how to create a database and create table over database
âœ…what is MySQL why we use: 
ðŸŸ£MySQL is RDBMS that make relation between server and database.
ðŸŸ£it is open source database software. 

âœ…difference between database and file? 
   we store information on database for permanently use. 
   we store the information on file for temporary use.
âœ…what is SQL and MySQL ?

âœ… SQL is structure query language and Its provide commands that deal with database by writing a query.
âœ… SQL : DDL, DML, DCL, TCL

âœ…DDL : stands for data definition language
       : (create, alter, drop, truncate, rename etc)  
ðŸ”µDDL stands for Data Definition Language, which defines the structure or schema of the database.

âœ…DML, or the Data Manipulation Language, helps us deal with managing and manipulating data in the database. 
ðŸ”µIt is stands for data manipulate language.
ðŸ”µ DML : insert, update, delete, retrieve etc. 

âœ…DCL: Data control language provide grant and revoke commands

âœ…TCL: TCL is a set of commands used to manage transactions in a database management system (DBMS)

ðŸ”µTCL commands are used to start, commit, and roll back transactions

09-04-2025: I learn about constraints, key, subquery and joins and Exercise on complex query using joins and clause.

ðŸ”µ Constraints: Auto Increment,  not null, check, default,  unique, primary key, foreign key
âœ… Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.
âœ… Not Null: it does not accept null value.
âœ… The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
âœ… Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
âœ… PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
âœ… However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.
âœ… foreign key: The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
âœ… A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

ðŸ”µ clause- where and  insert into statement.
âœ…Aliases:  it is used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

âœ… Apart from this I also learn about joins, what is self join, inner join, left join, right join, cross join,  multiple table.
ðŸ”µ what is joins?
âœ…  A JOIN : it is  clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
âœ…  self join:  is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
âœ…  The INNER JOIN :  keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
âœ…  The LEFT JOIN:  keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records (if any) from the right table (table2).
âœ…  The RIGHT JOIN: keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records (if any) from the left table (table1).
âœ…  The CROSS JOIN:  keyword returns all records from both tables (table1 and table2).

10-04-2025: I taken knowledge about Transactions, Commit and Rollback in MySQL RDBMS.
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. In databases, transactions ensure data integrity and consistency.

âœ…Understand What a Transaction Is
   >> A transaction is a group of operations that should be executed as a single unit.
âœ…Example: Bank transfer â€“ debit from one account, credit to another.

âœ…Importance of Transaction Management
  ðŸ”µ Helps in maintaining the consistency and reliability of data.
  ðŸ”µ Crucial for applications that deal with multiple related database operations.

âœ…ACID Properties
ðŸŸ£Learn the four key properties of transactions:
    ðŸ”µAtomicity â€“ All or nothing.
    ðŸ”µConsistency â€“ Data remains valid.
    ðŸ”µIsolation â€“ Transactions donâ€™t affect each other.
    ðŸ”µDurability â€“ Committed changes persist.

âœ…Commit Operation
     ðŸ”µCommit is used to save all the changes made by the transaction permanently in the database.
     ðŸ”µUsed to save all changes permanently.
     ðŸ”µOnce committed, changes cannot be rolled back.

      Example:

       BEGIN TRANSACTION;
       UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
       UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
       COMMIT;

âœ…Rollback Operation
      ðŸ”µRollback is used to undo all changes made in the current transaction.
      ðŸ”µUsed to undo changes if something goes wrong.
      ðŸ”µHelps prevent corrupt or partial data.
     
     Example: 
               BEGIN TRANSACTION;
               UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
               -- Something goes wrong here
               ROLLBACK;

     
âœ… Error Handling with Transactions

âœ… Learn how to use try-catch blocks in code (like JDBC in Java) to manage commits and rollbacks safely.

âœ…Real-Life Applications

  Used in banking systems, order processing, inventory updates, etc.

âœ… 11-04-2025:  Today I taken knowledge about Aggregate function in MySQL DATABASE

ðŸ“˜ Exercise: Student Score Analysis

âœ… Analyze student scores using aggregate functions like:

         ðŸ”µ AVG() â€“ to find average scores       
         ðŸ”µ MIN() â€“ to find the lowest score
         ðŸ”µ MAX() â€“ to find the highest score
         ðŸ”µ SUM() â€“ to calculate total scores
         ðŸ”µ COUNT() â€“ to count number of entries

âœ… Use GROUP BY and HAVING to:

  Group students or subjects for better summarized results
  Apply conditions on aggregate results (e.g., only show subjects with avg score > 75)

âœ… Combine JOIN with GROUP BY / HAVING to:

  Perform deeper analysis across multiple tables (e.g., join student info with scores table for complete insights)

ðŸŒŸ Advantages to use:
                ðŸ”µEfficient Data Summarization
                ðŸ”µPowerful Reporting
                ðŸ”µBetter Decision Making
                ðŸ”µReal-world Applications: Used in dashboards, analytics, and data-driven apps.
